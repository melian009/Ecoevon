# Ecoevon -- Eco-evolutionary networks 

#This repo contains three parts

A main talk in the folder TALK containing the lecture Eco-evolutionary networks with all the slides and the beamer latex files

A Jupyter notebook QUESTIONDRIVENEXERCISES sequentially introducing eco-evolutionary networks starting from single species trait distributions using the free software Octave kernel https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

and the ANIMATEDTALK folder containing a Jupyter python kernel talk to train our intuition and gain visual insights about complex problems in eco-evolutionary networks
